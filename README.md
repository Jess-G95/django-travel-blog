# django-travel-blog
A (work-in-progress) personal travel blog created with Django by following [this](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ib4HsrXEYpQnTOTZE1x0uc) tutorial on YouTube.
I adapted the code to fit the needs of a personal blog and included additional functionality, such as incorporating markdown in the blog posts.

## To do
* Remove test blogs
* Improve overall design of the website to look more appealing
* Add an option to include images within the blog posts
* Add tags/categories
* Add a nav bar that organises blog posts by categories
* Add a search bar
* Add and interactive map that links to categories
* Finish about page

## How to use
```
git clone https://github.com/Jess-G95/django-travel-blog.git
python manage.py runserver
```
